# Causal inference with transfer entropy: An introduction for beginners

This repository contains the materials for a workshop at the Society for Epidemiologic Research’s 57th Annual Meeting. Specifically, two documents are needed:

1. "nature.csv" - A dataset from a study that investigates the causal relationships between firearm acquisition, mass shootings, and media coverage of firearm regulations (Porfiri, M., Sattanapalle, R.R., Nakayama, S. et al. Media coverage and firearm acquisition in the aftermath of a mass shooting. Nat Hum Behav 3, 913–921 (2019). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-019-0636-0)
2. "transfer_entropy.R" - An R script containing functions to compute transfer entropy and related statistical tests.

To run the script effectively, download both files and place them in the same folder.
